A system and service monitoring framework based on NodeJS.


What about Monit?
=================

The next version of Monit "will be based on a non-blocking event driven architecture". It's other goal is to make monitoring configuration expressive and extensible. Which is how a system monitoring service should always be.

It simply makes sense to use the most popular, tested and hardened event driven architecture for a software that's ment to never be down: NodeJS. It comes with a web server built in, and as a bonus, you get direct access to extensibility in a fairly simple scripting language, JavaScript, supported by JSON and CoffeeScript.
